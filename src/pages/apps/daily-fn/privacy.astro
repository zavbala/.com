<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 20, 2025</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Daily FN</strong> provides Fortnite-related information such as 
  cosmetics, updates, and player stats. We respect your privacy and explain 
  below how data is handled.
</p>

<h2>No Data Collection or Storage</h2>
<p>
  Daily FN <strong>does not collect, log, or store</strong> any personal 
  information. The app does not gather analytics data, device information, 
  or user behavior, and we do not share data with any third parties.
</p>

<h2>Epic Games ID and Live Requests</h2>
<p>
  If you enter an Epic Games ID to view public Fortnite statistics, the app 
  uses that ID only to retrieve data from Epic Games' public APIs. These 
  requests are processed instantly and displayed to you in-app. Daily FN does 
  not save, cache, or record the Epic Games ID or any related information on 
  any server or storage.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  The app may connect to Epic Games' public API or other Fortnite data 
  providers. Those third parties maintain their own privacy policies. Daily FN 
  is not responsible for their practices; please review Epic Games' privacy 
  policy for details.
</p>

<h2>No Analytics, Cookies, or Ads Tracking</h2>
<p>
  Daily FN does not use analytics SDKs, cookies, or advertising trackers of 
  any kind.
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
  Because no user data is stored, there is nothing to delete. If you wish to 
  remove information held by Epic Games or another third party, please contact 
  them directly.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Daily FN is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect 
  information from children.
