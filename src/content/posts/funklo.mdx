Was 2020 and lockdown stared, so I decided to start to collection [Funko](https://www.funko.com) Pop figures.

My regular places to get them were my local retailers and Amazon, but I found that I was missing a lot of figures that I wanted, so I started to look for other places to get them.

So I decided to start scraping figures from these retailers and create a website to show them, the idea was simple users can enter to site and compare prices and availability from different retailers.

Funklo at first time has a weird name "fkmx" and I got the domain [funkomx.com](https://funkomx.com)

Today my store is selling 2K figures each month, but nothing about this would possible without stripe as my payment processor.
