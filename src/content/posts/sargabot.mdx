On 2021 I have a trip to Tulum, but enjoy the beaches around was a little tricky, cause most of them has a seaweed problem, so to guess what beaches are clean was a huge riddle.

So when I was back to home I decided to create an app to track the seaweed in the beaches, and I called it Sargabot.

My first try was to create a [twitter](https://x.com/sargabot) bot with Rust, (was my first interaction with rust, and a big challenge)

<Repo path="zavbala/sargabot" />

Until this day the twitter account has 60k followers. But to be honest a twitter bot is not enough, so I decided to create a website to track the seaweed in the beaches, and I called it [sargabot.com](https://sargabot.com)

Site is multilingual, you can track four different status of seaweed in the beaches, and you can see the history of the seaweed in the beaches.
